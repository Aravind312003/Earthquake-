# Earthquake:
Here we downloaded the earthquake data from kaggle.
First we are finding the duplicate and missing value and deleting it.
Then we are processing with the outliers.If it have higher outliers value,we are deleting it.
Then we are performaning univariate,bivariate,multivariate correlation analysis.
During multivariate correaltion analysis if its value is more than 5 we are removing it.
Then we are finding kmean cluster and silhouette score.
Then we are training and testing the data using models like linear regression,DecisionTree regression,GradientBoostingRegressor,logistic regression.
We have also performed decision tree.
